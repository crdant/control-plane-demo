<!-- 
DEPENDABOT PR TEMPLATE NOTE:
Unfortunately, Dependabot doesn't use custom PR templates. It generates its own PR descriptions.
This file documents the format Dependabot uses so you can understand its PRs.

Dependabot PRs will have:
- Title: "Updates [package] from [old-version] to [new-version]"  
- Body: Auto-generated with changelog, commits, compatibility info
- Labels: As configured in dependabot.yml
- Assignees: As configured in dependabot.yml

To make Dependabot PRs more consistent with your style:
1. The commit prefix is set to "Updates" to match your present-tense style
2. Labels help identify dependency PRs
3. Weekly schedule prevents PR spam
4. The CI workflow will run all checks automatically

While we can't make Dependabot follow your exact PR template, the commit messages
and PR titles will use present tense ("Updates") to be somewhat consistent.
